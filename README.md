[Zynthian](http://zynthian.org) is an Open Synth Platform based in Raspberry Pi, Linux (Raspbian) and Free Software Synthesizers (mostly).

The [ZynthianOS SD-image](https://os.zynthian.org/zynthianos-last-stable.zip) includes all the software you need for building a ZynthianBox, including a good amount of sound libraries and presets. This repository contains presets, samples, soundfonts and config files for the different synth engines supported by Zynthian.
